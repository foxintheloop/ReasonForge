# ReasonForge - Symbolic Mathematics Toolkit

> **Modular Symbolic Mathematics for LLM Integration**

ReasonForge is a comprehensive ecosystem of symbolic mathematics packages built on SymPy, NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn, exposed via MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. It provides 111 specialized tools across 7 focused servers, each targeting specific mathematical domains. Our goal is to achieve 100% accuracy and zero hallucinations for supported mathematical operations.

## Package Status

| Package | Tools | Status | Description |
|---------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **reasonforge-logic** | 13 | **Ready** | Symbolic reasoning and formal logic |
| reasonforge-expressions | 16 | Beta | Expression manipulation |

> **Note**: Only `reasonforge-logic` has been fully tested and documented for production use. Other packages are functional but may have edge cases not yet addressed.

**Key Features:**
- 🎯 **Modular Architecture** - Install only what you need
- 🔧 **SymPy-Powered** - Built on the proven SymPy symbolic mathematics library
- 📦 **Domain-Focused Packages** - Following industry standards (SymPy, SciPy, MATLAB)
- 🔬 **Research-Grade** - From quantum state representations to general relativity metrics
- 🎯 **Goal: Exact Computation** - Working toward 100% accuracy for supported operations

## Why ReasonForge?

ReasonForge provides **modular symbolic mathematics** for LLM applications. Instead of loading 111 tools you don't need, install exactly what your workflow requires.

### Benefits

Modular approach:
- ✅ Install only needed domains
- ✅ Clear domain separation (algebra, calculus, statistics, etc.)
- ✅ Fast startup and low memory
- ✅ Independent versioning per domain
- ✅ Follows mathematical taxonomy (like SymPy, SciPy, MATLAB)

## Quick Start (reasonforge-logic)

The production-ready MCP server with 13 tools for symbolic reasoning and formal logic.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/foxintheloop/ReasonForge.git
cd ReasonForge
pip install -e packages/reasonforge -e packages/reasonforge-logic
```

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "reasonforge-logic": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "reasonforge_logic"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Example Prompts

- "Find the pattern in [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] and give me the equation"
- "Convert (A OR B) AND C to conjunctive normal form"
- "Prove that a + b = b + a using commutativity"

## Design Goals

### What We're Working Toward

| Goal | Status |
|------|--------|
| Exact symbolic computation | Implemented via SymPy |
| Deterministic results | Achieved for most operations |
| Reproducibility | Achieved |
| Full coverage of mathematical domains | In progress |

### Token Usage (Context Window)

| Configuration | Tools Loaded | Token Usage | Reduction |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Monolithic Server** | 111 | ~8,000 tokens | Baseline |
| **Single Package** | 13-18 | ~800-1,200 tokens | **85-90% ↓** |

**Note**: Some tools provide symbolic formulations rather than complete solutions (e.g., physics equation setups). See individual package documentation for details.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Each package is independent, making it easy to:
- Add new tools to existing packages
- Create new domain-specific packages
- Improve documentation and examples
