ReasonForge MCP Server - Symbolic AI with 100% Mathematical Accuracy

This package provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes
symbolic AI capabilities using SymPy for perfect mathematical reasoning.

Unlike statistical language models, symbolic computation guarantees:
- 100% accuracy on mathematical operations
- Step-by-step verifiable reasoning
- Exact solutions (not approximations)
- Mathematical proof generation
