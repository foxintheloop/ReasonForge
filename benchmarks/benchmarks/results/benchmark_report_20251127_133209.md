## About ReasonForge

ReasonForge is a symbolic AI system built on SymPy that provides mathematically rigorous
computations with guaranteed accuracy. Unlike LLMs which may produce plausible but incorrect
answers, ReasonForge uses formal symbolic mathematics to ensure every result is verifiable.

**Key Benefits:**

- 🎯 **100% Accuracy** on symbolic mathematics (when properly configured)
- ⚡ **Fast** - Direct computation without API latency
- 💰 **Free** - No API costs or usage limits
- 🔒 **Private** - All computation happens locally
- ✅ **Verifiable** - Results can be independently checked
